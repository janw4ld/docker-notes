# Dockerfile

Dockerfiles are recipes for building the configuration and environment needed
to package and run a containerised application. They consist of instructions
that run inside a base image and interact with the build context (usually the
directory our `Dockerfile` is in)

We're gonna build our
[CMake project 1](https://github.com/hlarda/cmake/tree/main/1/cmake) inside
Docker as an example. It's a good practice to keep your docker images and
containers lightweight so we'll pick `alpine` linux as our base distro, default
alpine images are ~6MiB in size. Alpine is different to mainstream distros in
some aspects but we don't need to worry about them now.

Our build environment consists of CMake & GNU Make as well as the `g++`
compiler, so a Dockerfile to build it can look like this:


```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.19 AS builder

RUN apk add --no-cache \
  make \
  cmake

RUN apk add --no-cache \
  g++

WORKDIR /src # this creates directory `/src` then cds into it

# using --link when copying external files helps with caching, but doesn't work
# well with symlinks, so be careful when using it to avoid unexpected issues
COPY --link CMakeLists.txt .
COPY --link main.cpp .

RUN CXX=g++ cmake . && make

# this is bad practice, don't distribute your source code

CMD ["./HelloKittyexe"]
```

we'll save this file as `naive.Dockerfile` then use `docker build` to create an
image from it. the used command options are

- `-t hellokitty:naive` adds a "tag" -a human readable name- to the image
- `-f naive.Dockerfile` specifies which dockerfile to use
- `.` specifies the build context, which is the directory our dockerfile
  instructions will interact with, so for example `COPY main.cpp` in the
  dockerfile only knows which `main.cpp` to copy because we're inside the
  `1-basic-build` directory and passed the build context `.` (which means here
  or the current working directory)

```console
$ docker build \
    -t hellokitty:naive \
    -f naive.Dockerfile \
    .

This is not good, we shipped a huge package with all our dev dependencies and
the source code, to avoid this Docker introduced multi-stage builds, where we
can build the code in one image and copy pre-compiled binaries to another clean
image.

notice we had to install `libstdc++` in the final image because we dynamically
link our project to the stdlib, otherwise running the binary fails with
`/app/HelloKittyexe: file not found`. i also split the build command into two
layers to cache CMake's generated build scripts.

now, let's build this

    -t hellokitty:two-stage \
