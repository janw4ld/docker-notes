# Buildkit

[moby/buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is a newer cache-efficient
build system for Dockerfiles, it also provides more advanced features for builds
and cache management. Buildkit comes bundled with new Docker versions as the
subcommand `buildx`, we'll be using `docker buildx` to compile our
`HelloKittyexe` project for multiple architecture targets.

## but why??

building to multiple different platforms makes it easy to distribute software
to single-board computers and other embedded linux devices with unpopular
architectures, it also makes it easier to compile for devices with underpowered
hardware, like a Raspberry Pi, locally (& conveniently) in a more powerful dev
environment

## prerequisites

Docker virtualisation depends on

1. `qemu` and `binfmt_misc` support in the kernel, most modern kernels support
   these features out of the box.
1. `binfmt-support` >= 2.1.7, which can be installed on Debian-based systems
   with `apt install binfmt-support`.
1. registering `qemu` interpreters for the target architectures, by running
   `docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install linux/arm64`

## building for multiple architectures

we can build our project for multiple architectures with no modifications to the
Dockerfile

```console
$ docker buildx build --platform=amd64,arm64 -t hellokitty:multiplatform .

WARNING: No output specified with docker-container driver. Build result will only remain in the build cache. To push result image into registry use --push or to load image into docker use --load
```

notice the WARNING after the build:

> WARNING: No output specified with docker-container driver. Build result will only remain in the build cache. To push result image into registry use --push or to load image into docker use --load

`buildkit` creates multiplatform images in a format not yet supported by docker
(a manifest list), trying to `--load` images into the docker registry by default
-similar to the legacy builder behaviour- will error out. so we need to use
`--push` to export the multiplatform image to an external registry that supports
manifest lists.

we'll use dockerhub for this example, our prerequisites now are

- creating an account on [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
- creating a dockerhub personal access token with `write` permissions,
  [guide](https://docs.docker.com/security/for-developers/access-tokens/)
- creating a repository on dockerhub,
  [guide](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/create/), we'll name the repo
  `hellokitty`

after creating the account, the access token and the repo, we'll login to the
docker cli with this token

```console
$ docker login -u janw4ld
Password: <paste token here>

Login Succeeded
```

then build the image with the `--push` flag, we'll have to prepend the account's
username to the image name to be `janw4ld/hellokitty`

```console
$ docker buildx build --platform=amd64,arm64 -t janw4ld/hellokitty:multiplatform . --push

```

the `unknown/unknown` platforms are metadata that describe the build process of
the manifest list, they're used for supply-chain security & compliance, no need
to worry about them.

when running a multiplatform image, docker will select the appropriate platform
image and only download that from the list.

## what's next?

the performance overhead of virtualisation can't be glossed over, and builds can
sometimes take as much as 6x the time of a native build, so instead of qemu virt
we'll be looking at using `buildx` alongside
[tonistiigi/xx](https://github.com/tonistiigi/xx) to cross-compile our project
for multiple architectures with all build steps running natively on the host.
cross-compilation can be achieved on a build tooling level with CMake, but the
`buildx` approach is simpler and more flexible.
