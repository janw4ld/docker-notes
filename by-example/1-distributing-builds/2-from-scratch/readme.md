# Dockerfile 2, leaner and meaner?

in [1-basic-build](../1-basic-build/readme.md) we built a minimal `alpine` image 
that contained `libstdc++` and our `HelloKitty` executable. For security and
hardening purposes, it's better to not distribute any distro or base image at
all. We can do so by creating our final-stage image `FROM scratch`, which is an
empty image. But `FROM scratch` requires manually copying each and every runtime
dependency into the image. This is a tedious process that can be avoided by
statically linking our executable so that it contains all its dependencies. So,
working towards our goal of using a `FROM scratch` image we'll modify the
`CMakeLists.txt` file to statically link our project as follows:

```diff

```

after updating `CMakeLists.txt` we can drop `RUN apk add --no-cache libstdc++`
from our dockerfile steps:

## But why?

security; the less programs you package, the less attack surface you have,
especially when you don't distribute any shell or package manager in your image
